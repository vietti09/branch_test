Team Name: Mambo Number 5

We are going to view trends in data on happiness, Gross Domestic Product, Consumer Price Index, and Gross Domestic Income. The  data we are going to look at is from 2015-2017.

Working with data from dataworld: happiness data and consumer price index; Kaggle: happiness; world bank: gross domestic product and gross domestic income. We will be comparing csv files and making some really pretty charts.

We are going to ask if there is a relationship between happiness data and gross domestic product, consumer prices, and gross domestic income.

What are we going to do?
	Virginia: Clean up CPI data. Compare CPI to happiness. Make two charts.
	Ted: Clean up GDI data. Compare GDI to happiness. Make two charts.
	KV: Clean up GDP data. Compare GDP to happiness. Make two charts.
